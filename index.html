            <h2>About Diwali</h2>
            <p>Derived from the Sanskrit word deepavali, which means “row of lights,” Diwali is known for the brightly burning clay lamps that people put outside their homes during the holiday. It is a major Hindu festival celebrated to honor the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival typically lasts for five days and involves the lighting of lamps, candles, and fireworks. It's a time for family gatherings, festive meals, and the exchange of gifts. Diwali holds immense cultural and spiritual significance.</p>
